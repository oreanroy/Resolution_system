Customer Issue Resolution 
System 
PhonePe processes a vast number of transactions every day, wherein some transactions may fail 
(enter a FAILED state) or remain in a PENDING state due to various reasons such as bank or NPCI 
issues, or internal PhonePe errors. To handle such cases efficiently, a resolution system is needed, 
where customers can log their unsuccessful transactions and raise complaints against them. The system must categorize customer issues into several types, such as payment-related, mutual 
fund-related, gold-related, or insurance-related. Different customer service agents will have their 
specific expertise based on the issue type, whom the system will assign the issues by marking them 
waiting in case all agents are busy. 
The customer service agents can work on one issue at a time and update its status, and once it is 
resolved, the agent will receive another issue. 
The solution should incorporate the following features: 
●  Customers can log a complaint against any unsuccessful transaction. 
●  Customer Service Agents can search for customer issues with issue ID or customer details 
(email). 
●  Agents can view their assigned issues and mark them resolved once they are resolved. 
●  System should assign the issue to agents based on an assigning strategy. 
●  System should allow the admin to onboard new agents. 
●  System should allow the admin to view the agent's work history. 
Implementation requirements 
Your solution should implement the following functions. Feel free to use the representation for 
objects you deem fit for the problem and the provided use cases. The functions are ordered in the 
decreasing order of importance (highest to lowest). We understand that you may not be able to 
complete the implementation for all the functions listed here. So try to implement them in the order in 
which they are declared down below. 
createIssue(transactionId, issueType, subject, description, 
email) 
addAgent(agentEmail, agentName ,List<issueType>) 
assignIssue(issueId) // -> Issue can be assigned to the agents 
based on different strategies. For now, assign to any one of the 
free agents. 
JavaScript
getIssues(filter) // -> issues against the provided filter 
updateIssue(issueId, status, resolution) 
resolveIssue(issueId, resolution) 
viewAgentsWorkHistory() // -> a list of issue which agents worked 
on 
Example: 
createIssue("T1", "Payment Related", "Payment Failed", "My 
payment failed but money is debited", “testUser1@test.com”); 
>>> Issue I1 created against transaction "T1" 
 
createIssue("T2", "Mutual Fund Related", "Purchase Failed", 
"Unable to purchase Mutual Fund", “testUser2@test.com”); 
>>> Issue I2 created against transaction "T2" 
 
createIssue("T3", "Payment Related", "Payment Failed", "My 
payment failed but money is debited", , “testUser2@test.com”); 
>>> Issue I3 created against transaction "T3" 
 
addAgent(“agent1@test.com”, “Agent 1”, Arrays.asList("Payment 
Related", "Gold Related")); 
>>> Agent A1 created 
 
 
addAgent(“agent2@test.com”, “Agent 2”, Arrays.asList("Mutual Fund 
Related")); 
>>> Agent A2 created 
 
 
assignIssue("I1") 
>>> Issue I1 assigned to agent A1 
 
assignIssue("I2") 
>>> Issue I2 assigned to agent A2 
 
assignIssue("I3") 
>>> Issue I3 added to waitlist of Agent A1 
 
 
 
getIssue({"email": "testUser2@test.com"}); 
>>> I2 {"T2", "Mutual Fund Related", "Purchase Failed", "Unable 
to purchase Mutual Fund", "testUser2@test.com", "Open"}, 
 I3 {"T3", "Payment Related", "Payment Failed", "My payment 
failed but money is debited", , "testUser2@test.com", "Open"} 
 
getIssue({"type": "Payment Related"}); 
>>> I1{"T1", "Payment Related", "Payment Failed", "My payment 
failed but money is debited", "testUser1@test.com", "Open"}, 
 I3 {"T3", "Payment Related", "Payment Failed", "My payment 
failed but money is debited", "testUser1@test.com", "Open"} 
 
updateIssue("I3", "In Progress", "Waiting for payment 
confirmation"); 
>>> I3 status updated to In Progress 
 
resolveIssue("I3", "PaymentFailed debited amount will get 
reversed"); 
>>> I3 issue marked resolved 
 
 
viewAgentsWorkHistory() 
>>> A1 -> {I1, I3},  
    A2 -> {I2} 
Things to keep in mind 
●  Programming Language & Environment: You can use the programming language of their 
choice to implement the solution. Free to use any local IDEs, such as IntelliJ, or the 
CodeSignal platform for writing code. 
●  Scope of Implementation: Use of REST APIs is not required; implementing equivalent 
functions for the functional requirements is sufficient. 
●  Data Persistence: Persistence should be achieved using in-memory data structures (e.g., 
Lists, Queues, Maps), and no connection to databases is needed. 
●  Third-Party Libraries: It is recommended to refrain from using third-party libraries like 
Guava or Hystrix for functional requirements. 
●  Demonstrating Functionality: There is no need to handle command-line inputs, inputs can 
be hardcoded within a driver class. A main() class or driver or test cases that simulates the 
functional requirements is sufficient. 
●  Ambiguity in Problem Statement: If there is any ambiguity in the problem statement, you 
can make reasonable assumptions and proceed with the solution. These assumptions 
should be clearly called out in comments within the code for them to be discussed in 
evaluation round. 
●  Submission Guidelines: You must zip your solution files and email them to the provided 
email address (Email address must be available in Interview Invite Link). This must be done 
even if you choose to code on Code signal Platform. Please ensure you submit your solution 
on time even if it is incomplete. A partial solution submitted on time is better than a complete 
solution submitted after time.
